        That's it. No more. I refuse to accept the realities of Magento development and web development in general. I refuse to accept absurdities of Magento development I refuse to accept that it's apparently perfectly ok for different browsers to interpret the same code differently, to say nothing of the fact that Internet Explorer has an almost 7 % market share, I refuse to accept that I have to spend 2+ hours setting up a new Magento project locally because something inevitably goes wrong. Why do these go wrong? Because they can.
        It sure feels good having gotten this out of my system and truth be told it has been building up for a while. This blog will follow my journey to becoming an iOS developer. I hope to document the ups and downs, the obstacles and wonders I encounter on my way there and hopefully once there (and I will get there!) it may be of service to someone else deciding to embark on the same/similar voyage.
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post__subtitle">Throwback</h2><br>
        Why am I doing this? Why am I altering course in my career at the age of 26? Well, how well do you remember your history lessons from school? Specifically, how well do you remember your 1st World War lessons? I always loved history lessons, and learning about the Great War provided a clear example of how a single spark can wreak havoc if only there's a big enough powder keg nearby. Imperialism and politics could be thought of as the powder keg that made the old continent ready for war, and the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand as the spark that ignited it.
        I have always been a fan of Apple and it's ecosystem (smooth transition, huh? Bear with me.). As far as I am concerned, the pluses of such an enclosed environment absolutely outweigh the minuses. There is order, predictability, security, stability, and reliability. I like that.
        As such, it should not be difficult to see how I was drawn to iOS development. I like Apple's products and I like writing code, so why on Earth would I not write code for devices that I enjoy using?
        In this respect, my affinity for the iOS ecosystem could be thought of as the proverbial powder keg and the rant in the first paragraph of this post as a spark. Me actually altering course towards iOS development was not a question of if, it was a question of when, and the accumulation of my grievances with the Web and Magento provided and answer as to when. Soon!
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post__subtitle">Seriously?</h2><br>
        At this point you would be justified in asking yourself:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Did he really use a 1st World War analogy to explain his shift from Web to Mobile development? Yes, I did.
            </li>
            <li>
                Was it necessary? Not at all.
            </li>
            <li>
                Does he regret it? Does it matter?
            </li>
            <li>
                Was it really the best analogy he could've used to drive home the point? Absolutely not!
            </li>
            <li>
                Why did he do it then? Well, it's my journey and I'm paying for the hosting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Is this the kind of writting we can expect in the future? I wish I knew.
            </li>
        </ul><br><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post__subtitle">So now what?</h2>
        Now that you know why I'm doing it, my future posts may make more sense. I'll be writing about stuff that I am building, things that I am learning about and the troubles I'm coming accross. I'll keep track of my portfolio as it (hopefully) grows, things that I find interesting and/or annoying in iOS development. I will also be writing about content creators and/or content sources that I like.
